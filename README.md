# 📚 ML Basics - Follow-Along Guide

Welcome to the **ML Basics** repository! 🚀  
This is an **(almost) daily guide** covering fundamental concepts in Machine Learning (ML) with hands-on Jupyter Notebooks.  

## 📌 **About This Repo**
This repository contains **step-by-step Jupyter notebooks** to help you (as well as me) understand the underlying functions in ML.    
  
Each notebook is structured with **theory, code examples, visualizations, and interactive exercises**—covering concepts I feel I need to understand better while actively learning.

## 💡 **Why I'm Doing This**
I'm documenting concepts that I personally want to **understand better** and **explain more clearly**.  
I can train and use ML models, but I want to go deeper—  
🔹 **What exactly do these functions do behind the scenes?**  
🔹 **How does each part contribute to ML architecture?**  
🔹 **Why does a certain technique work better in some cases?**  

This repo is my **learning playground**, and if you're also curious about these things, feel free to explore, suggest, or contribute!
